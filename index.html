    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Webpage!</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Steven Vernikov. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at NJIT. I am passionate about technology, computers, and cooking. At Brookdale Community College, I was actively involved in the Food Science & Nutrition club, which enhanced my knowledge in the sciences behind certain foods and the way they function.</p>

    <p>In addition to academics, I work part-time at Method Group, where I assist in desktop support technological issues. I have a keen interest in cybersecurity and am always eager to expand my knowledge in this field.</p>
